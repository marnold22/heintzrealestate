                        Hey I’m Ben Heintz. I believe in being genuine and serving people. I was born and raised in the
                        Spokane and Couer’d’Alene area, and now I get to be a realtor with Synergy Properties on the
                        Dream Team with hundreds of years of combined experience. I help people accomplish their real
                        estate goals from buying their first home to selling their 5th, to investors and flippers who do
                        this multiple times a year. I love continuing to grow and learn and being able to share that
                        journey with others. I want to be able to serve people in the ways I’d want them to treat my
                        family.

                        defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although
                        we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information

                    Verification process
                    <br><br>
                    Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same
                    person about whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to
                    ask you to provide information so that we can match it with information you have previously provided
                    us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain
                    information so that we can match the information you provide with the information we already have on
                    file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g. , phone or email) that you have
                    previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.
                    <br><br>
                    We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority
                    to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from
                    you for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the
                    information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the
                    purposes of verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete
                    such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.
                    <br><br>
                    Other privacy rights
                    You may object to the processing of your personal information.
                    You may request correction of your personal data if it is incorrect or no longer relevant, or ask to
                    restrict the processing of the information.
                    You can designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA on your behalf. We may deny a
                    request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been validly authorized
                    to act on your behalf in accordance with the CCPA.
                    You may request to opt out from future selling or sharing of your personal information to third
                    parties. Upon receiving an opt-out request, we will act upon the request as soon as feasibly
                    possible, but no later than fifteen (15) days from the date of the request submission.
                    To exercise these rights, you can contact us by email at ben@heintzrealestate.com , or by referring
                    to the contact details at the bottom of this document. If you have a complaint about how we handle
